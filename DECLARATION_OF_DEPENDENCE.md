# Declaration of Dependence

**This system depends on Echo Memory Governor for responsibility.**

---

## What This Means

stop-first-rag is **structurally dependent** on Echo Memory Governor.

This is not a technical dependency.
This is an **ethical and architectural dependency**.

---

## The Dependence

stop-first-rag depends on Echo Memory Governor for:

1. **Snapshot-based context** — RAG uses snapshots (NOT raw database queries)
2. **Pending exclusion** — Snapshots constitutionally filter pending items
3. **Evidence citation** — Every RAG result references snapshot lineage
4. **No vector scoring** — Context selection based on snapshot membership, not similarity

**Removing this dependency invalidates accountability claims.**

---

## What Breaks If Governor Is Removed

Without Echo Memory Governor:

❌ **RAG context becomes untraced** — No snapshot references
❌ **Pending items leak into context** — No constitutional exclusion
❌ **Vector scores return** — No snapshot-based selection
❌ **Evidence becomes unverifiable** — No lineage tracking

stop-first-rag becomes **just another RAG system**.

---

## Why This Is a Declaration

This is not a README dependency note.
This is a **constitutional declaration**.

If you:
- Query memory directly (bypass snapshots)
- Include pending items in context
- Add vector similarity ranking
- Remove snapshot lineage references

**You are no longer running stop-first-rag.**

You are running something else.

---

## What "Dependence" Means

### Technical Dependence (Normal)
- Library imports
- API calls
- Data formats

### Constitutional Dependence (This)
- **Evidence structure**
- **Pending exclusion**
- **Lineage requirement**

stop-first-rag's **claim to cite evidence** depends on governor.

Remove governor → Remove evidence claim.

---

## Integration Points

stop-first-rag depends on:

1. **Snapshot-based context** — RAG reads from snapshots only
2. **Pending exclusion** — Snapshots filter pending automatically
3. **Lineage metadata** — Every RAG result includes parent chain
4. **Audit views** — Evidence traced to approval events
5. **No scoring** — Context selected by snapshot membership, not similarity

---

## What This Proves

This declaration proves:

1. **RAG can cite evidence** — Without hidden scoring
2. **Context can be traced** — Via snapshot lineage
3. **Pending cannot leak** — Snapshots constitutionally exclude it

---

## For Forks and Derivatives

If you fork stop-first-rag:

### ✅ You MAY
- Improve RAG algorithms
- Add new retrieval strategies
- Optimize query performance
- Change ranking methods (within snapshot)

### ❌ You MAY NOT (and still claim evidence)
- Query memory directly (bypass snapshots)
- Include pending items in context
- Remove snapshot lineage references
- Hide context sources

If you remove the dependency:
- **Do not claim this cites evidence**
- **Do not use the stop-first name**
- **Do not reference this constitution**

---

## Evidence Is External

stop-first-rag does NOT:
- Generate its own context without snapshots
- Decide what memory is approved
- Hide context sources

stop-first-rag DEPENDS on external systems:
- **Echo Memory Governor** for snapshot structure
- **Pending exclusion** for isolation
- **Audit views** for lineage tracking

---

## Final Statement

**This system depends on Echo Memory Governor for responsibility.**

Not for convenience.
Not for features.
For **the ability to claim RAG results cite evidence, not hidden scores**.

**Removing this dependency invalidates accountability claims.**

---

**Declared:** 2026-01-11

**Repository:** stop-first-rag

**Constitution:** Echo Judgment Constitution v1.0
