**AI systems fail not when they are wrong,
but when they execute when they should not.**

---

## What This Repository Is

This repository introduces **STOP as a first-class outcome** in AI systems.

It reframes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and agent pipelines
around a single question:

**"Should the system execute at all?"**

The goal is not to improve answers,
but to **prevent costly execution when judgment is uncertain or inappropriate**.

---

## The Problem

Most AI systems share the same structural flaws:

* **Execution is the default** — generation implies action
* **Judgment is implicit** — buried inside model behavior
* **Non-execution is invisible** — you cannot prove that nothing happened

As a result, responsibility is blurred and failure costs explode.

---

## The Judgment Boundary

This work separates *judgment* from *execution*.

Instead of optimizing for answers, systems explicitly decide between:

* **STOP** — do not execute
* **HOLD** — defer to a human or another authority
* **ALLOW** — execution is permitted

Correctness is secondary.
**Execution control is primary.**

For the full conceptual map, see:

**Start with Tier 1 (specs) for concepts, Tier 2 (proofs) for evidence.**

## Tier 2 — Operational Proof

Design and documentation are not sufficient to establish trust.
Stop-first must be shown to work **during execution**.

The following repository contains sealed operational evidence:

- **stop-first-operational-proof**
  - Two identical automation pilots
  - One completed normally
  - One stopped immediately when a forbidden impulse was detected
  - Same task, same inputs, exactly one constraint difference

This repository is not a framework or a tool.
It is a record that **stopping is a controlled outcome, not a failure mode**.

## Who This Is For

* Platform / infrastructure engineers
* AI governance, audit, and compliance teams
* Agent and orchestration framework designers

**Not** intended for:

* Prompt engineering
* End-user AI tooling
* Content filtering use cases

---

## What This Is Not

* ❌ Not a filter
* ❌ Not alignment or RLHF
* ❌ Not content moderation
* ❌ Not "AI safety" by blocking outputs

This work exists to **preserve human responsibility**
by proving when AI systems **did not decide**.

## Start Here

If you arrived from another repository:

→ **Start here:** `stop-first-rag`
→ **Understand the map:** `JUDGMENT_BOUNDARY_MANIFEST.md`
→ **Then explore individual layers**

---

### Status

* Public reference point
* Documentation-first
* No code execution required to understand the system
