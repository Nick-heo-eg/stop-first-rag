{"chunk_id": "qc_002", "text": "Unlike classical bits that exist in states of 0 or 1, quantum bits (qubits) can exist in superposition of both states simultaneously. This allows quantum computers to perform certain calculations exponentially faster than classical computers.", "source": "quantum_basics.pdf", "relevance_score": 0.92}
